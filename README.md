# WashWatch

Things that need to be standardised so that the code doesn't break:

Android version used for development:
SDK version:

Current structure:
1. Landing page (MainActivity.java + activity_main.xml): Contains the 3 BLK buttons to be selected
2. Washer page (Displays 10 washers, coloured RED or GREEN based on availability): Each RED washer is selectable and a card pops up displaying the time remaining
3. Dryer page (Displays 10 dryers, coloured RED or GREEN based on availability)
